# ToDoList
Practicing TDD by creating a simple Web API project.

I started this project by watching some Tim Corey videos. I wanted to practice Test Driven Development to help deepen 
my understanding for projects I test in my day to day role as an Automation Engineer and to try and focus on making sure
I understand exactly what I am developing before diving in. I have done so by creating a task board in Trello found
here: https://trello.com/b/6hegE4V1/to-do-list-project-personal-development

By breaking down my test tasks before starting the development of the Web API, I can think of all the various scenarios to 
account for and exactly what is it that I am trying to develop. I have opted for very basic functionality so I can keep the project
focused and at an appropriate level for myself to make progress alongside time to read. A simple CRUD operation, with additional
functionality such as filtering (by task completed true/false)

I really enjoyed working with minimal APIs due to how much bloat it has removed from the code for such a simple project. For my next
project I would like to convert this to a traditional controller just to further practice my back-end development skills.
